# Trade-Resilience-Economic-Networks

Data Premier League (Trade Resilience & Economic Networks)

The Data Premier League (DPL) is a global economic resilience challenge using data from 25 countries between 2000 and 2024. It brings together trade, GDP, demographics, disasters, agriculture, and welfare indicators into a single framework to forecast what economies might look like in 2030 under different crisis and policy scenarios. The project focuses on cleaning and integrating diverse datasets, engineering composite indicators like trade dependency and resilience scores, and applying machine learning models to predict GDP growth, poverty, and vulnerability levels. It also simulates scenarios such as trade collapses, global recessions, and climate disasters to assess their impact on national and global resilience. Visualizations like heatmaps, trade networks, and shock maps support insights and policy recommendations aimed at helping countries strengthen their resilience and protect their people.
